## Why BYOB?

> 1. Many people working along the spectrum from <span class='blue2'>Biology
     </span> to <span class='blue2'>Computer Science</span> at NIH.
> 2. There are already some great meeting series covering topics along these lines at
     NIH...
> 3. However, most of these (research talks, journal clubs, etc.) tend to be focused on research,
     and not on the tools and methods used along the way.
> 4. It's likely that many people are solving the same problems, indepdendently
     throughout NIH.
> 5. Also, few socially-oriented meetings directed at people across this spectrum
     currently exist.

## Goals

> 1. Bring people with shared interests <span class='blue2'>across the spectrum
     </span> together to share ideas, help each other out and also to learn what
     each other is doing.
> 2. Short, practical tutorials and presentations
> 3. Discussions relating to the presentation (and anything else on people's minds..)
> 4. Have fun.

---

## Who?

> - Anyone who is either working on or interested in topics that fall along this
spectrum: researchers, students, post-docs, technicians, etc
> - Both those with experience and those who are interested.

## Presentations

Presentations will typically be short (15-45 minutes) and may fall into a
couple different categories:

1. <span class='blue'>Low-level</span>, focused tutorial on how to perform some
   particular task.
2. <span class='blue3'>High-level</span>, broad tutorial describing some
   interesting tool or technology and how it might be used.

Of course, not all presentations will fall into these categories, and that's
okay too.

## Topics Covered

BYOB will include a very wide range of topics:

> - Bioinformatics
> - Computational Biology
> - Data analysis
> - Programming
> - Statistics
> - Machine Learning
> - Software pipelines
> - Visualization
> - Software Engineering
> - Reproducible Research
