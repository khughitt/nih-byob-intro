## Why BYOB?

> 1. Many people working along the spectrum from <span class='blue2'>Biology
     </span> to <span class='blue2'>Computer Science</span>.
> 2. There are some good meetings for people working in these areas (e.g. CBMG
     and CBCB RIPs).
> 3. However, some people's work may not fit nicely into either of these.
> 4. RIPs/JCs are typically focused on research and not on the tools used along
     the way.
> 5. Also, few socially-oriented meetings directed at people across this spectrum
     currently exist.

## Goals

> 1. Bring people with shared interests <span class='blue2'>across the spectrum
     </span> together to share ideas, help each other out and also to learn what
     each other is doing.
> 2. Short, practical tutorials and presentations for the 1st half of meeting.
> 3. Discussion and socializing in 2nd half of meeting.
> 4. Have fun.

## Who?

> - Anyone who is either working on or interested in topics that fall along this
spectrum: students, faculty, post-docs, technicians, etc
> - Both those with experience and those who are interested.

## Presentations

Presentations will typically be short (15-45 minutes) and may fall into a
couple different categories:

1. <span class='blue'>Low-level</span>, focused tutorial on how to perform some
   particular task.
2. <span class='blue3'>High-level</span>, broad tutorial describing some
   interesting tool or technology and how it might be used.

Of course, not all presentations will fall into these categories, and that's
okay too.
